# Biography

I am currently a Data Scientist at Stride Health, where I am working on projects
focused on filling in the benefits gap faced by self-employed workers. This
includes shopping for health insurance, tracking and calculating expenses for
taxes, and providing financial support and advice.

My education background was in Statistics and I was particularly interested in
the computational side of things. I am a heavy user of
[R](https://www.r-project.org), occasional dabbler in
[Python](https://www.python.org), and hope to contribute to the development of
packages that help make the most common analytics tasks as easy as possible. I
am waiting for a world where I can easily switch between R and Python. I am
aware that packages such as [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/)
and [rpy2](http://rpy2.readthedocs.io/en/version_2.8.x/introduction.html) exist,
and appreciate the wonderful work that's been done so far, but in the end I
still find myself unsatisfied.
